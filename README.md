# macos-customs

This is a collection simmilar to [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/dgrebb/dotfiles), but aims to specifically install, configure, and customize applications and macos itself.

## Files

### Brewfile

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a fantastic package manager for macos. One may keep a `Brewfile` which can be used to `brew bundle install`.

It's easy to generate one of these yourself. Just run `brew bundle dump` in a directory you'd like to save the `Brewfile`.

Big shoutout and thank you to @cliss for covering this in an [excellent post on caseyliss.com](https://www.caseyliss.com/2019/10/8/brew-bundle).
